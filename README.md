# BORT2
Pytorch implementation of BORT<sup>2</sup> (["Zhongying Deng, Da Li, Yi-Zhe Song, Tao Xiang. Robust Target Training for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation". BMVC 2022]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01676))

## Installation

Please install the [Dassl codebase](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/Dassl.pytorch#get-started), and then copy the files in this repository to Dassl. 
When asked to overwrite, say yes (some `__init__.py` files may be overwritten, these files is modified to include the trainer used for BORT<sup>2</sup>).
Then `pytorch 1.7.1 + cuda 10.1, python 3.7` will be installed.

**This is a must, otherwise, some files may be missing.**

============ **code** =============

The zip file `Dassl_BORT2.zip` contains an initial version of the code for BORT<sup>2</sup>, but it will be further updated. The instructions for using the code can be found at ([this issue](https://github.com/Zhongying-Deng/BORT2/issues/1#issuecomment-1655890786))
